   Fortunate Harbingers 

Signals signals everywhere
Sine, square and ramp, 
Signals signals everywhere
Triangular and pulse

Like a mother giving birth to new born baby
Function generator produces them
Wondering  these  have siblings

Guide to doctors and engineers,
Nightmare for students , 
Lucky to hear those secrets of lovers
Understanding everyone's emotions
Birds ,animals and humans
Dispatch rider of messages 


Adding subtracting and multiplying
Growing and transforming
My mind boggles at these miracles 
Hats off to the owner of such brains
